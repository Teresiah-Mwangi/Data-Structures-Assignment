 Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations using Linked List Implementation

This C program demonstrates the implementation of various operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST) using a linked list representation. 
 Description

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure where the value of each node is greater than all values in its left subtree and less than all values in its right subtree. 
This program implements a BST using a linked list representation and provides functionalities to manipulate the tree.

 Functionality

The program provides the following functionalities:

1. **Insertion**: Nodes can be inserted into the BST.

2. **Deletion**: Nodes can be deleted from the BST.

3. **Traversal**: The program supports inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal of the BST.

4. **Height Calculation**: The height of the BST can be calculated.

5. **Node Information**: Users can find the level and height of a specific node in the BST.
